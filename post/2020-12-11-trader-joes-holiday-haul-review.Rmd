Happy holidays to everyone!

Last week, a couple of my friends and I bought some of the holiday snacks/products at trader joes to taste test and review. We gave each item a rating from 1-10 and the ratings are in the order [Mark, Allison, Devika]. Here are our takes: 

1) Mini Gingerbread People

[5,6.5,8.5]

2) Peppermint Chocolate Chunk Cookie Mix

[7,6,6]

3) Dark Chocolate Covered Peppermint Joe Joe's

[9,9,8.5]

4) Dark Chocolate Covered Minty Mallows

[4,4,2]


Okay now let's look at the ratings data! 
```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 

one = np.array([5.5,6.5,8.5])
data1 = pd.Series(one, index =["mark","allison", "dev"], name='gingermen')

two = np.array([7,6,6])
data2 = pd.Series(two, index =["mark","allison", "dev"],name='cookiemix')

three = np.array([9,9,8.5])
data3 = pd.Series(three, index =["mark","allison", "dev"], name='joejoes')

four = np.array([4,4,2])
data4 = pd.Series(four, index =["mark","allison", "dev"], name='mintymarshmallow')

data = pd.concat([data1,data2,data3,data4], axis=1)
dataflip = data.T
print(dataflip)

```

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

summary(py$data)
```

After looking at the summary data, we can see that the joejoes were clearly the most liked snack! Go get em! #This post is not sponsored by Trader Joes.
